Weekly task 6
Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods).
I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
This is a more difficult task than some of the others, but will be marked equally, so only do as much work on this as you feel comfortable.

Newtonâ€™s Method: Let N be any number then the square root of N can be given by the formula: 
root = 0.5 * (X + (N / X)) where X is any guess which can be assumed to be N or 1.
In the above formula, X is any assumed square root of N and root is the correct square root of N.
